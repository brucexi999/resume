\section{Project}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{May-Oct. 2023}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{Concurrent IC Global Routing with Multi-Agent
Deep Reinforcement Learning}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Demonstrated initiative by independently mastering DRL and IC global routing through exhaustive self-study and comprehensive literature review
    \item Designed an innovative multi-agent DRL framework to address the IC global routing challenge in a concurrent manner
    \item The proposed work guaranteed 0 overflow and outperformed an A* baseline by 2.6\% in terms of wirelength
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{Jan.-Apr. 2023}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{Embedded System Design}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Designed key components of an embedded system including a 4-way set-associative cache controller and a DRAM controller using Verilog. The cache reduced the runtime of a benchmark by 43\%
    \item Implemented the system on an FPGA with a provided soft microcontroller 
    \item Developed software and firmware in C that interacted with hardware using SPI, IIC, and CAN protocol 
    \item Utilized hardware timer interrupt and designed a snake game software that ran on the embedded system
    %\item Project repository and demonstration videos can be found on GitHub (repo name: UBC-CPEN-412)
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{June-Sept. 2022}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{CPU Architecture Design}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Architected a 16-bit RISC CPU from the ground up using Verilog, integrating pivotal components such as FSM, datapath, RAM, and I/O interfaces
    \item The CPU supported 13 diverse instructions encompassing ALU operations, memory access, and branching mechanisms
    \item Successfully deployed the system onto an FPGA and validated the design's capabilities by executing a test program
\end{itemize}
}

\section{Experience}
\cventry{May-Dec. 2022}{Design Validation Co-op}{Motorola Solutions}{Vancouver, BC}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Conducted extensive camera tests, ensuring precision both in lab settings and office environments
    \item Developed Python-based software, realizing test automation and data analysis, resulting in a significant enhancement in test efficiency. Some tests achieved automation of up to 90\%
    \item Collaborated effectively within a team framework, leveraging tools like Git and Jira for optimal workflow management 
    \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{June-Aug. 2021}{Undergraduate Research Assistant}{University College London}{London, UK}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Played an integral role in the research team by meticulously taking measurements and preparing samples
    \item Demonstrated analytical skills by independently evaluating vast datasets and presenting insights effectively to the research group, fostering informed decision-making
    \end{itemize}
