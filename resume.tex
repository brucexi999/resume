\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{May-Oct. 2023}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{Concurrent VLSI Routing with Multi-agent
Deep Reinforcement Learning}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Independently mastered reinforcement learning and VLSI global routing through exhaustive self-study and comprehensive literature review
        \item Developed a novel machine learning framework to address the VLSI global routing problem in a concurrent manner, integrating multi-agent reinforcement learning with deep neural networks
        \item Addressed training challenges by fine-tuning hyperparameters through a grid search approach, leading to significant performance improvements
        \item Actively contributed to research group meetings by sharing project insights and progress, effectively communicating complex technical details to supervisors and peers
        \item The proposed work overcame the traditional net-ordering issue, guaranteed zero overflow, and outperformed an A* baseline by 2.6\% in terms of wirelength
        \end{itemize}
}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{Jan.-Apr. 2023}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{Embedded System Design}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Designed key components of an embedded system including a 4-way set-associative cache controller and a DRAM controller using Verilog. The cache reduced the runtime of a benchmark by 43\%
    \item Implemented the system on an FPGA with a provided soft microcontroller 
    \item Developed software and firmware in C that interacted with hardware using SPI, IIC, and CAN protocol 
    \item Utilized hardware timer interrupt and designed a snake game software that ran on the embedded system
    %\item Project repository and demonstration videos can be found on GitHub (repo name: UBC-CPEN-412)
\end{itemize}
