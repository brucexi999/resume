\section{Project}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{May-Oct. 2023}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{Concurrent VLSI Routing with Multi-agent
Deep Reinforcement Learning}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed a Python-based machine learning framework to address the VLSI global routing problem in a concurrent manner. This framework modeled routing as a pathfinding task and solved it using multi-agent reinforcement learning integrated with deep neural networks (MLP and GNN implemented in PyTorch)
        \item Addressed training challenges by fine-tuning hyperparameters through a grid search approach, leading to significant performance improvements
        \item The proposed work overcame the traditional net-ordering issue, guaranteed zero overflow, and outperformed an A* baseline by 2.6\% in terms of wirelength
        \end{itemize}
}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{Sept.-Dec. 2023}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{Computer Architecture Simulator}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed four cache replacement policies in C++ for the ChampSim simulator, achieving Instruction Per Cycle (IPC) and hit rates comparable to the Least Recently Used (LRU) policy
        \item Transformed the simulator's pipelined CPU into a non-pipelined structure by comprehensively analyzing and modifying the existing C++ code
        \item Implemented two branch prediction algorithms in C++, resulting in IPC and accuracies on par with a established baseline
    \end{itemize}
}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{Jan.-Apr. 2023}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{Microcomputer System Development}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Engineered key components of an microcomputer system including a 4-way set-associative cache and a DRAM controller using Verilog. The cache reduced the runtime of a benchmark by 43\%
    \item Implemented the system on an Altera FPGA with a soft core provided by the course 
    \item Developed software and firmware in C that interacted with hardware (Flash, EEPROM, and ADC/DAC) using SPI, IIC, and CAN protocol 
    \item Utilized hardware timer interrupt and designed a snake game software that ran on the system and interact with the player using VGA
    \end{itemize}
}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{June-Sept. 2022}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{CPU Design and Assembly programming}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Architected a 16-bit RISC CPU from the ground up using Verilog, integrating pivotal components such as FSM, datapath, RAM, and I/O interfaces. The CPU was implemented on an Altera FPGA
    \item The CPU supported 13 diverse instructions encompassing ALU operations, memory access, and branching mechanisms
    \item Implemented preemptive multitasking on a ARM core integrated on the FPGA using Assembly
\end{itemize}
