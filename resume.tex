\section{Project}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{May-Oct. 2023}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{Concurrent VLSI Routing with Multi-agent
Deep Reinforcement Learning}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed a novel machine learning framework to address the VLSI global routing problem in a concurrent manner, integrating multi-agent reinforcement learning with deep neural networks
        \item Addressed training challenges by fine-tuning hyperparameters through a grid search approach, leading to significant performance improvements
        \item The proposed work overcame the traditional net-ordering issue, guaranteed zero overflow, and outperformed an A* baseline by 2.6\% in terms of wirelength
        \end{itemize}
}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{Jan.-Apr. 2023}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{Embedded System Development}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Engineered key components of an embedded system including a 4-way set-associative cache controller and a DRAM controller using Verilog. The cache reduced the runtime of a benchmark by 43\%
    \item Implemented the system on an FPGA with a provided soft microcontroller 
    \item Developed software and firmware in C that interacted with hardware using SPI, IIC, and CAN protocol 
    \item Utilized hardware timer interrupt and designed a snake game software that ran on the embedded system
    \end{itemize}
}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{June-Sept. 2022}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{CPU Architecture Design}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Architected a 16-bit RISC CPU from the ground up using Verilog, integrating pivotal components such as FSM, datapath, RAM, and I/O interfaces
    \item The CPU supported 13 diverse instructions encompassing ALU operations, memory access, and branching mechanisms
    \item Successfully deployed the system onto an FPGA and validated the design's capabilities by executing a test program
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{Jan.-Apr. 2022}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{System-on-Chip Design}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Designed an SoC which was implemented on an FPGA using Quartus IP Catalog, the system consisted of a soft CPU, an on-chip memory, a memory-mapped interconnect, and I/Os
    \item Designed custom hardware using Verilog that adhered to the interconnect's communication protocol 
    \item Scripted C programs to interact with the system
    \end{itemize}
}
