\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{Feb. 2024}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{AXI Stream Header Insertion}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Designed a Verilog RTL module for inserting headers into network packets, adhering to the AXI Stream protocol. The module receives headers and data packets from two master interfaces and sends them to one slave after processing and arbitration
        \item Implemented pipelining for both data and handshake signals, incorporating skid buffers to eliminate bubbles and efficiently manage backpressure
    \end{itemize}

%{\textnormal{\textbf{Concurrent VLSI Routing with Multi-agent
%Deep Reinforcement Learning}}}
%{}{}{}
%{
    %\begin{itemize}
        %\item Developed a Python-based machine learning framework to address the VLSI global routing problem in a concurrent manner. This framework modeled routing as a pathfinding task and solved it using multi-agent reinforcement learning integrated with deep neural networks (MLP and GNN implemented in PyTorch)
        %\item Addressed training challenges by fine-tuning hyperparameters through a grid search approach, leading to significant performance improvements
        %\item The proposed work overcame the traditional net-ordering issue, guaranteed zero overflow, and outperformed an A* baseline by 2.6\% in terms of wirelength

{\textnormal{\textbf{Computer Architecture Simulator}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Optimized matrix multiplication in C by leveraging tiling and loop reordering techniques, altering memory access patterns and increasing cache hit rate by a factor of 8
        \item Developed four cache replacement policies and two branch prediction algorithms in C++ in the ChampSim simulator
    \end{itemize}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{Jan.-Apr. 2023}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{Microcomputer System Development}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Engineered key components of a microcomputer system including a 4-way set-associative cache and a DRAM controller using Verilog. The cache reduced the runtime of a benchmark by 43\%
    \item Implemented the system on an Altera FPGA with a soft core provided by the course 
    \item Developed software and firmware in C that interacted with hardware (Flash, EEPROM, and ADC/DAC) using SPI, IIC, and CAN protocol 
    \item Utilized hardware timer interrupt and designed a snake game software that ran on the system and interact with the player using VGA
    \end{itemize}
