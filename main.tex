\section{Projects}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{May-Oct. 2023}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for VLSI Routing}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Demonstrated initiative by independently mastering DRL and VLSI global routing through exhaustive self-study and comprehensive literature review
    \item Successfully modelled and implemented the physical routing problem in Python
    \item Crafted an innovative multi-agent DRL model to address the routing challenge, leveraging the sophisticated capabilities of Python libraries
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry
{\textnormal{\textbf{Jan.-Apr. 2023}}}
{\textnormal{\textbf{Embedded System Design}}}
{}{}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Designed key components of an embedded system including a 4-way set-associative cache controller and a DRAM controller using Verilog. The cache reduced the runtime of a benchmark by 43\%
    \item Implemented the system on an FPGA with a provided soft microcontroller 
    \item Developed software and firmware in C that interacted with hardware using SPI, IIC, and CAN protocol 
    \item Utilized hardware timer interrupt and designed a snake game software that run on the embedded system
    %\item Project repository and demonstration videos can be found on GitHub (repo name: UBC-CPEN-412)
\end{itemize}
}

\section{Experience}
\cventry{May-Dec. 2022}{Design Validation Co-op}{Motorola Solutions}{Vancouver, BC}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Orchestrated a comprehensive range of camera tests, ensuring precision both in lab settings and office environments
    \item Developed Python-based software, realizing test automation and data analysis, resulting in a significant enhancement in test efficiency. Some tests achieved automation up to 90\%
    \item Collaborated effectively within a team framework, leveraging tools like Git and Jira for optimal workflow management 
    \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{June-Aug. 2021}{Undergradate Research Assistant}{University College London}{London, UK}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Played an integral role in the research team by meticulously taking measurements and preparing samples
    \item Demonstrated analytical skills by independently evaluating vast datasets and presenting insights effectively to the research group, fostering informed decision-making
    \end{itemize}
